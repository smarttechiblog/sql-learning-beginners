1. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
DML is used for managing data within schema objects. It allows users to perform operations on the data stored in the database. Common DML commands include:

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
INSERT: Adds new rows of data to a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
DELETE: Removes rows from a table.
2. DDL (Data Definition Language)
DDL is used for defining and managing all database objects, such as tables, indexes, and schemas. It deals with the structure (schema) of the database. Common DDL commands include:

CREATE: Creates a new database object (e.g., table, index).
ALTER: Modifies an existing database object (e.g., adding a column to a table).
DROP: Deletes an existing database object.
TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table but keeps the structure intact.
3. DCL (Data Control Language)
DCL is used to control access to data within the database. It includes commands that manage permissions and access rights. Common DCL commands include:

GRANT: Gives a user access privileges to database objects.
REVOKE: Removes access privileges from a user.
Summary
DML: Focuses on data manipulation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
DDL: Focuses on database structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE).
DCL: Focuses on access control (GRANT, REVOKE).
